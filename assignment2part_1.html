                    <h3>Shane Watson aka watto</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chennai Super Kings returned in IPL 2018. MS Dhoni and CSK management showed faith in the Aussie and bagged his services.<br>
                        Watson put an end to his poor form and silenced his critics in style. He took six wickets and scored<br>
                        a mammoth 555 runs, scoring his third and fourth IPL centuries in the process.<br>
                        CSK went on to win the IPL that year and Watson was the hero as he scored a century in the final.

                    <h4>Mike hussey aka Mr cricket</h4>
                    <p>
                        Michael Hussey is the highest run-scorer among foreign players for CSK.

                        Michael Hussey would be one of the opening batsmen in this all-time CSK XI.<br>
                        The Australian is the highest run-scorer among the foreign players for CSK.<br>
                        Mr. Cricket, as he is fondly known, was the winner of the Orange Cap for the Chennai-based franchise in IPL 2013.<br>
                        
                        Overall, Hussey has aggregated 1768 runs in the IPL for CSK, at a healthy average of 42.09 and a strike rate of 123.63.<br>
                         His average is the best among all CSK players who have played a minimum of ten innings in the IPL, behind only MS Dhoni.

                    <p>
                        Faf du Plessis started his IPL journey with the CSK and has played for them ever since.<br>
                        The right-handed batter played an all-important knock in the Finals of the 2021 edition of the league,<br>
                         scoring 86 runs off 59 deliveries, thereby winning the Player of the Match for the same.<br>
                        In 2018, Punjab Kings bought Faf for INR 1.6cr, but but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card<br>
                        and it sure was a bargain for them. While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings<br>

                    <p>
                        Ambati Rayudu played a significant role in CSK's title-winning run in 2018.

                        Ambati Raydu would be the pick for the No.4 position in CSK's all-time XI.<br>
                         The Hyderabad batsman was one of CSK's stand-out performers in IPL 2018,<br>
                          as the Chennai-based team bagged the title after a two-year hiatus from the competition.
                        
                        Rayudu has scored 884 runs at an average of 34.00 and a strike rate of 125.39<br>
                         in the last two seasons for CSK
